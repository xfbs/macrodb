# MacroDB

This is a crate that lets you automatically generate code for an in-memory database in Rust. It supports indexes, including unique indexes, as well as foreign keys. It can use [HashMap](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/hash_map/struct.HashMap.html) as well as [BTreeMap](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.BTreeMap.html) for the indices.
